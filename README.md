# Psst!

Have you ever walked by a computer that has been left unlocked and unattended? Do you want to teach the person who left it unlocked a valuable lesson, while also maybe making them question their sanity? If so, you've come to the right place!

## What is this?

This is a simple web page that, with the click of a button, will start whispering sweet (and slightly unhinged) nothings into the ear of an unsuspecting user at random intervals. It's a prank, a joke, and a public service announcement all rolled into one.

## The Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It):

1.  Find an unlocked, unattended computer.
2.  Open [this page](https://digitalsolitude.com/labs/psst/) in a new tab.
3.  Click the ðŸ™ˆ button in the top right.
4.  Hide the tab and walk away cooly.
5.  Listen for the "Psst! Hey!" from a safe distance and enjoy the ensuing confusion.

## The Moral of the Story

Always lock your computer when you walk away from it. You never know what might be lurking in the shadows, waiting to speak to you.
